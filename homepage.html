        <h2>About Us</h2>
        <p>We all know fitness is by no means a one-day journey but rather a lengthy and even endless lifestyle.
            We all have different goals whether it be weight loss,muscle gain or you generally just want to
            purse a healthier and fitter life. Moreover, it can become tedious and even harder to track your fitness updates daily
            through mundane methods and other applications, more so by yourself! In addition,there are so many complicated approaches to
            health and fitness as there are myriads of resources online,whether it be good or bad resources. The
            fitness industry and stereotype makes it seem way more complicated than it actually is.
            when in reality it is really much more simple.</p>

           <p> This is where myFitnessjournal comes into play. Our goal is
            to eliminate the complexity and stereotype behind the fitness industry by allowing users to track simple data such as
            weight,height, activity level and personalized training programs. Furthermore, our vision is to connect other users
            that are on similar journeys so that they know that they are not in this alone. Based on your engagement with the application,
            points/rewards would be given out and will serve as encouragement or even make it a fun little competition.
               In addition, to help those on fitness journeys, myFitnessjournal will allow selections of multiple exercises and meal templates from our extensive database. We at myFitnessjournal
        want the best for you, and we are here to make sure you are consistently at your best and not in this journey alone!</p>
